# Day 1: Let and Const

Objective

In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Declare a constant variable, , and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
Read a number, , denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
Use  and  to calculate the  and  of a circle having radius .
Print  as the first line of output and print  as the second line of output.
Input Format

A single integer, , denoting the radius of a circle.

Constraints

 is a floating-point number scaled to at most  decimal places.
Output Format

Print the following two lines:

On the first line, print the  of the circle having radius .
On the second line, print the  of the circle having radius .
