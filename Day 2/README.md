# Day 2: Conditional Statements: If-Else

Objective

In this challenge, we learn about if-else statements. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, , denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her  according to the following rules:

If , then .
If , then .
If , then .
If , then .
If , then .
If , then .
Input Format

Stub code in the editor reads a single integer denoting  from stdin and passes it to the function.

Constraints

Output Format

The function must return the value of  (i.e., the letter grade) that Julia earned on the exam.

Sample Input 0

11
Sample Output 0

D
Explanation 0

Because , it satisfies the condition  (which corresponds to D). Thus, we return D as our answer.


# Day 2: Conditional Statements: Switch

Objective

In this challenge, we learn about switch statements. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the getLetter(s) function in the editor. It has one parameter: a string, , consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). It must return A, B, C, or D depending on the following criteria:

If the first character in string  is in the set , then return A.
If the first character in string  is in the set , then return B.
If the first character in string  is in the set , then return C.
If the first character in string  is in the set , then return D.
Hint: You can get the letter at some index  in  using the syntax s[i] or s.charAt(i).

Function Description

Complete the getLetter function in the editor below.

getLetter has the following parameters:

string s: a string
Returns

string: a single letter determined as described above
Input Format

Stub code in the editor reads a single string denoting  from stdin.

Constraints

, where  is the length of .
String  contains lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z) only.
Sample Input 0

adfgt
Sample Output 0

A
Explanation 0

The first character of string  is a. Because the given criteria stipulate that we print A any time the first character is in , we return A as our answer.
